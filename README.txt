This repository contains applications for the Arduino Esplora board. 

Additional hardware may be required for an application.

EsploraGravGame - a gravity game bouncing between platforms.  Requires the Adafruit
                  1.8" TFT display plugged into the display header.  Uses tilt of accelerometer
                  to move ball.  Switch 3 enables bonus ball behavior if special
                  platforms are struck.  See http://blog.makezine.com/2013/01/14/arduino-esplora-video-game/
                  Based on game by R0D0T at 
                  http://hackaday.com/2012/10/01/fantastic-programming-makes-this-arduino-gaming-device-something-special/
                  
EsploraPong - also requires the Adafruit 1.8" LCD display on the expansion header.  Uses right buttons to
              control the left paddle, Arduino plays the right paddle.

EsploraTest - also requires the Adafruit 1.8" LCD display on the expansion header. Interactively test buttons,
              sensors, potentiometer, joystick, mic, buzzer, and setting of the RGB LED.  Interactive menus.
